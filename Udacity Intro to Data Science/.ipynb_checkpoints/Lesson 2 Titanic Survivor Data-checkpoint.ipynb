    "In this exercise, we will perform some rudimentary practices similar to those of\n",
    "    an actual data scientist.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Part of a data scientist's job is to use her or his intuition and insight to\n",

    "    to make predictions based on some attributes from the data that they are examining.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We would like for you to take your knowledge and intuition about the Titanic\n",

    "    Here's a simple heuristic to start off:\n",
    "       1) If the passenger is female, your heuristic should assume that the\n",
    "       passenger survived.\n",
    "       2) If the passenger is male, you heuristic should\n",
    "       assume that the passenger did not survive.\n",
    "    \n",

    "    via passenger[\"PassengerId\"]) and the associated value should be 1 if the\n",
    "    passenger survied or 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if a passenger is predicted to have survived:\n",
    "    passenger_id = passenger['PassengerId']\n",
    "    predictions[passenger_id] = 1\n",
